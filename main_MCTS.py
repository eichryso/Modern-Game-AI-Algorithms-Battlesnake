    An implementation of a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agent for Battlesnake. The agent builds a search tree of game states, simulates random playouts to evaluate potential moves, 
    and selects the move that leads to the most promising outcomes based on visit counts. The MCTS agent is operating within an 800ms time budget. The final move decision is based on 
    the child node with the highest visit count, which indicates the most explored and potentially best move.
    The agent consists of the following main components:
    1. Selection: Traverses the tree using the UCT formula to select child nodes until it reaches a node with untried moves or a terminal state.
    2. Expansion: If the selected node has untried moves, it expands the tree by creating a new child node for one of the untried moves.
    3. Simulation: Performs playout from the new node until a rollout depth is reached to evaluate the outcome of that move. When the heuristic flag is set to True, the simulation is guided by a heuristic agent instead of random moves,
                   which can lead to more informed evaluations and better performance.
